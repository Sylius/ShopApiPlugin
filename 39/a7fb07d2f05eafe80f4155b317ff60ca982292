@JakobTolkemit Could you fix the merge conflicts and then mention lchrusciel to check it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PR is checked already. What we need here is one more functional test. Just to check if the order is addressed twice only one address exists in the database.

Is that a thing to test with unit or better with spec?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spec is already there. I would add one unit with it.

I'll see if I can get to it today.

Thanks for contributing to the ShopApiPlugin and welcome to the community.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up. Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute git fetch origin && git reset "fix_order_addressing" to update your local branch. Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck. :+1:
