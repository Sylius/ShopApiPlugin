Fixing #263, probably we should document some UPGRADE.md file

Also, it should be adjusted at least [here](https://github.com/Sylius/ShopApiPlugin#attributes)

But for which version?

We need to create a new record in https://github.com/Sylius/ShopApiPlugin/blob/master/UPGRADE.md, and notice all the changes, that are BC-Breaks. Problem is that we are over 200 commits from the last release. Nevertheless, some changes that are pretty straightforward to describe.

(just to keep a track #340)

Can you generate a list of all the commit messages and I will try to craft a `UPGRADE.md` that reflects those changes.
