> I just have one two things: Would you mind summarizing in a comment what requirements have changed. I see there is no longer support for Symfony 4, we also dropped Sylius 1.10 anything I missed? Furthermore, do we need a change log entry for the upgrade or should it continue to work out of the box?

Hi @mamazu!
Yeah it should work out of the box, also with these updated .env files the steps in the `Readme` file are the same. I updated the description with the changes as You requested 💃🏽. The continuation of this PR is [here](https://github.com/Sylius/ShopApiPlugin/pull/736) where I also add SF6 support

@TheMilek That's great. Then I'll merge it. Never mind. Hubkit isn't working. Can you merge it?
