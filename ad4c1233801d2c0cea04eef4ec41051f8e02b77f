Thanks for your pull request, the idea is great the problem I see though is that this changes the response codes and the response structure very drastically.

Well the validation message structure is different. I'd say that this is a problem indeed. If there is a way to hook into that, this would be great other than that this would cause a very big inconsistency with the current validation views, which I wouldn't really like.

Let's merge it and see what feedback from the community we will receive. In any case, we can always revert this change.
