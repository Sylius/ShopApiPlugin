@Zales0123 @GSadee can you check if we need to cover anything else or is it good2go?

And of course, @gorkalaucirica thanks for contributing! :)

@lchrusciel The test was incorrect. `$productAttributeValue->getValue()` returns an array instead of an string.

In case the PR needs more changes just let me know

If you could provide one integration test with PHPUnit that would be awesome, but I'm aware that it won't be trivial. I would like to have a confirmation form my colleagues, and we can merge it.

@lchrusciel I've been checking integration tests, but I need some time to get the whole picture.

If you consider merging it I can try to add coverage to this use case.

It's a nice feature, so I'd be ok with merging it, but also keeping in mind (and event better on issues list) to cover it better with PHPUnit test as @lchrusciel have already suggested. Anyway, good job üëç ;)

We have two vote's for merging, so I guess we will merge it. But, as was mentioned, we should have an additional unit test. @gorkalaucirica will you give it a try?

@lchrusciel @Zales0123 Integration tests added, it was easier than expected üí™ .

Those tests are enough?

I had to change German translations, select choices are not translatable.

@gorkalaucirica I will iterate one more time over this PR in the nearest future. But first of all, I need to publish a stable release of this plugin

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@lchrusciel Are you releasing another beta or 1.0.0?

This is a BC break in the returned values from the API, so if it's the later will have to wait until 2.0.

Thanks for contributing to the ShopApiPlugin and welcome to the community.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up. Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute git fetch origin && git reset "feature/product-attribute-view-select" to update your local branch. Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck. +1
